	<h1>Brief Introduction</h1>
	<h2>I could tell my story in 1,000 or more words, but it would be a lot easier just to show the places that best capture my essence.</h2>
	<p>I’ve been to a bunch of different places – even as far across the world as Italy – but there are only seven I have in mind that are true to me. For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b><u>place I was born</u></b> is an integral part of my existence. Although I don’t know much about my birth, it’s the place I took my first breath.</li>
			<li>My <b><u>elementary and middle school</u></b> years were critical in my intellectual development, but there are also friends and memories from those places that are embedded in my core.</li>
			<li>The same can be said about <b><u>high school and my summer camp</u></b>, but those places have a more tangible and viewable impact on who I am today.</li>
			<li>There are other stupid spots that might not mean anything to you, but mean <i>everything</i> to me. </li>
		</ul>

		<p>All of these places are a part of who I am and you can see them all on
